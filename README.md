# BEA - Sanitize Filename

This plugin will remove all punctuation and accents from the filename of uploaded files, which is pretty handy.
You could then ask "Why it's not already into core?". This is [make WordPress core](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22363) !

# How ?

## Requirements

- No requirements

## Installation

As we assume this is a must have plugin, it's recommended to use at it as mu-plugin. As it is a folder, you must use a MU Loader : https://github.com/BeAPI/wp-mu-loader.

### WordPress

- Download and copy the plugin folder into your must-use plugins folder.
- Nothing more, this plugin is ready to use !

### [Composer](http://composer.rarst.net/)

- Add repository source : `{ "type": "git", "url": "https://github.com/BeAPI/bea-sanitize-filename" }`.
- Include `"bea/sanitize-filename": "dev-master"` in your composer file for last master's commits or a tag released.
- Nothing more, this plugin is ready to use !

# What ?

## Features

* All accented letters will be converted to same letters without accent
* Special characters will be deleted
* Underscores will be replaced by hyphens

## Compatibility for MAC owners

On MAC, you can also create an accented character with the combination of *<code>`</code>* and the wanted letter. This has the effect to create a character with a special filename system encoding format which is not sanitized.
An [issue](https://github.com/BeAPI/bea-sanitize-filename/issues/1) is open about this.
